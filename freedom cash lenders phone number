Try to imagine a mechanism that doesn't look at a consumer's credit history, gender, sex, religion, or income, awards them with money whenever they ask, and potentially serves as an individual's only means of acquiring emergency money. This non-discriminatory monetary mechanism comes with a catch though: it has an exorbitantly high interest rate and is built in such a way that some say they inherently trap their users in a never-ending downward spiral of financial hardship and debt. No, this isn't a hypothetical concept brought about for a philosophy class's ethics discussion. What we're talking about is a payday loan.

The Anatomy of a Payday Loan

Payday loans are a type of financing that requires no more than a post-dated check in return for cold, hard cash. They're the preferred method of acquiring cash advances on one's paycheck, particularly for those with bad credit ratings or no credit scores at all, since collateral and history are foreign and useless concepts to payday lenders.
